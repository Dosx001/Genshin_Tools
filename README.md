## Random Event
The Random Event page keeps track of the daily number of in-game [Random Events](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Random_Event) left. Users can subtract one from the counter using the “-1” button. The counter resets every 24 hours. The page also features a video guide on how to effectively complete Random Events.

Future implementation of the Random Event page will allow users to pick a time zone to allow the counter to reset at the appropriate time.


## Pity Counter

The Pity Counter page keeps track of users’ number of wishes made for each banner. Users can increase the counter by using the “+1” or “+10” button. If users’ in-game pity counter resets when they pull a 5-star item, users can also reset their Genshin Tools pity counter to 0 by using the “Reset” button. The counters will also automatically reset when they hit pity, at 90 rolls for Character and Standard banner and 90 for the Weapon Banner.

# Concept

## Timers

Many resources in Genshin Impact have 24, 48, or 72 hours respawn rates. Having timers will allow users to farm for resources more effectively. Users would be able to set a 24, 48, or 72 hour timer that counts down. Users will be able to set an icon to the timer to distinguish which resource the timer is designated to. Also, the timer would be nameable to help users give a location or any useful information to the timer.
